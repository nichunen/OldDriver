```java
/**
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy. 

 A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 

 
 Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the 
squares of its digits. 
 Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops 
endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
 Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy. 
 

 Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: n = 2
Output: false
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1
