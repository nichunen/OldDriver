```java
/**
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is 
in the range [1, n] inclusive. 

 There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number. 

 You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only 
constant extra space. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= n <= 10⁵ 
 nums.length == n + 1 
 1 <= nums[i] <= n 
 All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer 
which appears two or more times. 
 

 
 Follow up: 

 
 How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums? 
 Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
